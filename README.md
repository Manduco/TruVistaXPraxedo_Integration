# TruVista & Praxedo Integration

## <ins>Overview</ins>
  This project provides basic data integration between **TruVistaâ€™s CHR_Omnia360 ERP/CRM** application and **Praxedoâ€™s WorkOrder and Dispatch application**. The solution is an **OnPremise .NET Application** that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data between the two systems, ensuring accurate synchronization.

### Solution Architecture

*This diagram outlines the major components of the system integration.*

### Wireframes (Draft)

*Preliminary wireframe sketch of the application UI workflow.*

###  <ins>User Stories</ins>
1. **System Administrator**  
   *As a system administrator, I want the integration to handle API authentication automatically using secure credentials so that I donâ€™t have to configure it manually.*
2. **Operations Manager**  
   *As an operations manager, I need work orders from CHR to be automatically synced to Praxedo and vice versa so that my team can focus on field operations instead of data entry.*
3. **Data Analyst**  
   *As a data analyst, I want account and contact information to be consistently updated between CHR and Praxedo so that reporting and customer records remain accurate.*
4. **Field Technician**  
   *As a field technician, I need completed work orders in Praxedo to reflect updates in CHR in real time so that my job completion status is accurately recorded.*
5. **DevOps Engineer**  
   *As a DevOps engineer, I need comprehensive logging and error-handling for each data sync so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve any integration failures.*


##  <ins>Use Cases</ins>
### **Use Case 1: Synchronizing Accounts/Contacts**
- **Actor:** System Administrator
- **Precondition:** API credentials are configured
- **Steps:**
  1. The scheduled task runs at a defined interval.
  2. The integration extracts account and contact data from CHR_Omnia360.
  3. The data is transformed into Praxedoâ€™s expected format.
  4. The data is sent to Praxedo via API.
  5. Logging captures success or failure.
- **Postcondition:** Accounts and contacts are updated in Praxedo.

### **Use Case 2: Work Order Sync**
- **Actor:** Field Technician
- **Steps:**
  1. A work order is updated in Praxedo.
  2. The scheduled task detects the update.
  3. The integration retrieves the updated work order.
  4. The transformed data is sent back to CHR.
  5. The system logs the sync result.

## **Next Steps**
- [ ] Finalize wireframe sketches using **Draw.io** or **Pencil Project**.
- [ ] Create architecture and use-case diagrams.
- [ ] Populate repository with initial `.NET` project structure.
- [ ] Set up API credentials and data mapping in CHR and Praxedo.
