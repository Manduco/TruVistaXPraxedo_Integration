# TruVista & Praxedo Integration

## <ins>Overview</ins>
  This project provides basic data integration between **TruVistaâ€™s CHR_Omnia360 ERP/CRM** application and **Praxedoâ€™s WorkOrder and Dispatch application**. The solution is an **OnPremise .NET Application** that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data between the two systems, ensuring accurate synchronization.

### Solution Architecture

### Wireframes (Draft)

*Preliminary wireframe sketch of the application UI workflow.*

###  <ins>User Stories</ins>
1. **System Administrator**  
   *As a system administrator, I want the integration to handle API authentication automatically using secure credentials so that I donâ€™t have to configure it manually.*
2. **Operations Manager**  
   *As an operations manager, I need work orders from CHR to be automatically synced to Praxedo and vice versa so that my team can focus on field operations instead of data entry.*
3. **Data Analyst**  
   *As a data analyst, I want account and contact information to be consistently updated between CHR and Praxedo so that reporting and customer records remain accurate.*
4. **Field Technician**  
   *As a field technician, I need completed work orders in Praxedo to reflect updates in CHR in real time so that my job completion status is accurately recorded.*
5. **DevOps Engineer**  
   *As a DevOps engineer, I need comprehensive logging and error-handling for each data sync so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve any integration failures.*
